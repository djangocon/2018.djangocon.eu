If you're not travelling from inside the EU/Schengen area to Heidelberg, you may well need a visa to enter the country.

<!-- more -->

First off, check if you actually need a visa to visit Germany. If you're a citizen of one of the countries in the
EU/Schengen area, you will only need valid government ID (e.g. a passport) to enter the country. (The same goes if your
spouse or child is a citizen of one of those countries *and you're travelling together*.) If you're not sure, check the
website of the German embassy or consulate to your country.

If you do need a visa, check the website of the German embassy (usually something ending in "diplo.de") to your country
for a list of things you need to apply for a short-term visa to Germany. You'll probably be looking for at filling in a
visa application form in your country's language, provide some additional information, and pay a fee of about EUR 60.

You will also probably need a letter of invitation to confirm that you're indeed visiting DjangoCon Europe. To receive
an invitation, please [send us an email](mailto:2018@djangocon.eu) including the following information:

- Your first and last name, as on your official documents
- Your date of birth
- Your current address
- Your passport number
- The full address of the embassy or consulate you're applying to
- Your current occupation (or anything else we should supply as context/reason for the invitation)
- Your order code/url for your DjangoCon ticket

As visa applications can take some time to get processed, now is the best time to start yours!
