After our hard working review team has decided on talks, and the selected speakers have confirmed their participation,
we're excited to announce our speaker lineup!

<!-- more -->

We're happy to see such a great variety and depth in topics – and that we're hosting both new speakers and well-known
faces from our community. For all ideas that don't quite fill the length or depth of a talk, we're also going to have
**Lightning Talk** slots. Sign-up for Lightning Talks will be on-site at the talk venue.
