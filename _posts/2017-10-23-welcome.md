Hi there!

We are happy and excited to show you our current plans for DjangoCon Europe 2018! A lot is still bound to change, and
we will put up more information over time, but we have fixed the dates and the locations, and our general timeline.

<!-- more -->

We've collected some information on Heidelberg as well as some notes on accessibility and our code of conduct
here for you to browse. In the background, we are working out the details of the conference to be able to start
selling tickets and accept talk submissions in early December.

Right now, we are actively looking for [sponsors](/sponsoring/). If you happen to know anyone who might be interested
in sponsoring DjangoCon Europe, be sure to send them here -- or tell us to contact them.
You can reach our sponsorship team for all questions at sponsors@djangocon.eu.

If you want to keep updated, check out our [RSS feed](/feed.yml), [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope)
or [newsletter](https://rose-conferences.us16.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=cbdcd50b247322e1cd933e89a&id=6021912195).
Please take a look around the page, and if anything is missing, tell us!
