We have released our schedule – take a look!

<!-- more -->

After a bit of shuffling things around, we have released our [schedule](https://2018.djangocontent.eu/hd/schedule/).
As the conference is still a month away, it may still change, but we hope that the overall structure will remain as is.
If changes in the schedule are important to you, you can [subscribe to its RSS feed](https://2018.djangocontent.eu/hd/schedule/feed.xml)
to get notified of all changes.

As you can see, we have two slots planned for Lightning Talks, which we're very excited about. Lighting Talks are very
short (3-5 minutes) presentations – everybody attending DjangoCon Europe can give a Lightning Talk (time permitting, of
course). It's a great way to tell the community about a cool project you started, a funny or unexpected way a project
failed, or anything else that is important to you! Just keep the Lightning Talks in the back of your mind for the coming
weeks, and every time you do something interesting, or stumble upon a (Python, but not necessarily) weirdness you did
not expect, consider how you'd put it into a Lightning Talk!

You'll be able to sign up for Lightning Talks in Heidelberg, no pre registration needed.
