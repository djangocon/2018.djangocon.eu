As our CfP goes into its second half, we're ready to announce speaker mentors – help and advice if you're not sure what
to submit to DjangoCon Europe.

<!-- more -->

### Content

While DjangoCon Europe has much more to offer than just talks, the talks are still the core of the conference, around
which everything else is built. To make DjangoCon Europe talks great for every attendee, we'll try to have some
interesting talks for everyone – and the best thing you can do to help, is to submit your talk!

### Community

Because we're not just looking for any old tech talk – we're looking for talks from, by (and about) our community. No
issue relating to Django and the Django community is too big or too small to warrant a talk slot, open slots permitting.

Now, we know that submitting a talk can be nerve-wracking even for experienced speakers, and even more so to people who
are inexperienced. Since we want to invite everybody to feel comfortable to submit talks, we'd like to introduce our
speaker mentors – wonderful people who are experienced speakers, and who'll be happy to offer help and advice regarding
your talks. They can help you to formulate a vague idea, or be a sounding board on the best direction you could develop
a talk that's already half way done.

- [Katie](mailto:katie@glasnt.com) has spoken about emoji, JavaScript, security, and being nice to people, in half a
  dozen countries.
- [Russell](mailto:russell@keith-magee.com) has spoken (rapidly) about various Python and Django projects, as well as
  his personal experience in tech, and is a serial DjangoCon visitor.
- [Tom](mailto:tom@tomchristie.com) has spoken about API design, Django Rest Framework and sustainable open source
  development.

Don't hesitate to contact them if you aren't *quite* ready to submit your DjangoCon Europe talk – or, if you'd like to
be a speaker mentor yourself, [contact us](mailto:2018@djangocon.eu)!
