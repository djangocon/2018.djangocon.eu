Lots and lots of good news ‚Äì today is the start of both our ticket sale **and** our Call for Participation, so no matter
if you want to be a regular participant or a speaker, now's the time to get started (while the Early Bird tickets last)!

### Tickets

Today, as our [timeline](/timeline) so cleverly predicted, marks the start of our ticket sale ‚Äì as tradition demands, we
start out with **Early Bird üê§ Tickets** for a reduced price. Early Bird tickets are currently planned to be available until
end of January, so be sure to get your's soon!

Buying an Early Bird üê§ Ticket isn't just great for you (woo reduced prices!), it also helps us by helping us estimate the
amount of attendees we will have, and to give us more time to handle any special requirements you may have.

You will notice that our ticket pricing allows you to input a ticket price of your choice. With the additional money, we
are able to make it a more inclusive conference by investing in accessibility improvements as well as our 
[opportunity grant](/grants) program, helping people with little resources, and/or a lack of representation in our community
to participate in DjangoCon Europe 2018. Please choose to give more if you can ‚Äì you'll have a very direct impact on how
wonderful our conference and our community will be.

We want to extend our thanks to the (Django-based!) <a href="https://pretix.eu">pretix.eu</a> for hosting our presale.

### Talks

Talks are the main attraction in a conference, especially in a single-track conference as DjangoCon Europe. We will post
a separate blog post once we are sure how many talks there will be and what our selection process will look like.
We are also currently coordinating with potential mentors for speakers, so if you are on the fence on whether to submit
a talk ‚Äì stay tuned for our next blogposts!

We're looking for talks and tutorials (which will take place during sprints) ‚Äì you have until March 1st to submit your
talk, but since you can edit a submission up until then, why don't you get started right away? To get an idea what kind
of talks we are looking for, have a look at our [CfP](https://2018.djangocontent.eu/hd/cfp), or at the talks and
[schedules](http://2013.djangocon.eu/talks/)

[the](http://2011.djangocon.eu/schedule/)
[last](https://2016.djangocon.eu/schedule/)

We want to extend our thanks to the (Django-based!) <a href="https://pretalx.org">pretalx.org</a> for hosting our CfP.
