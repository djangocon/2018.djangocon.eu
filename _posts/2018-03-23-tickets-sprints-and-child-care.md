Good news – many of you have already purchased their DjangoCon Europe ticket! In fact, we have nearly as many
registration for the sprints (which are on the last two days of DjangoCon Europe) as the venue can sustain.

<!-- more -->

If we reach that limit, we won’t be able to allow more sprint registrations, so if you don’t have your DjangoCon ticket
yet, and you plan to attend the sprints, now would be a good time to get your ticket.

On a similar note, we have to start negotiations with our child care provider soon, so if you plan to bring your
child(ren) to Heidelberg and want child care during the conference, please tell us no later than **April 5th**. You can
tell us either by filling in the child care request when buying a ticket, and we’ll contact you, or by contacting us
directly via 2018@djangocon.eu

Last but not least, we were able to move up our timeline a bit and we’ll be able to present you our speaker lineup a
week from now, so stay tuned!
