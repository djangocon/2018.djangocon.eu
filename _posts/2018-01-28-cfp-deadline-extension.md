We're extending our CfP and opportunity grant application deadlines in support of the global diversity CfP day!

<!-- more -->

On February 3rd, [global diversity CfP day](https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/) takes place. It is a global
accumulation of workshops to help first time speakers submit proposals to all kinds of conferences and events.

DjangoCon Europe is firmly committed to a diverse community, so we couldn't let this day pass just outside our original
deadline of January 31st. We've decided to extend our deadlines (both for the opportunity grants and the CfP) until
**February 6th**. We look forward to your submissions!
