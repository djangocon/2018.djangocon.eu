## Opportunity Grants

DjangoCon Europe 2018 will offer grants to attendees and speakers. So that those who might otherwise not be able to attend won't hesitate. 

Some expenses for attending the conference (which can include travel, hotel, registration and etc..) will be covered for opportunity grant recipients.  

We actively encourage people to apply for opportunity grant. While we wish we could give grants to everyone who applies, we do not have the funds to do that. Our goal is to get the most people to Django Con by optimizing the funds we have.

By "optimazing" we mean several things.

*
  Conferences are a meeting place for developers from all around the globe. Therefore, the selection process is designed to benefit people that we believe make difference, particularly speakers and tutorial presenters, as well as notable open source contributors.

* 
  Additionally, the selection process attempts to promote a more diverse Django Con. While encouraging diversity is a broad effort, we're happy to say that the opportunity grant program has been a important factor in our results so far.
  
*
  Finally, the process tries to help people with relatively lower incomes, be it because of their location (lower income countries) or their profession (such as students, or the unemployed).


And finaly, our opportunity grant program encourage people who are part of an underrepresented or marginalised group in tech.
These include but are not limited to:

* women and other gender minorities of all expressions and identities; e.g. trans, agender and non-binary people
* people of color
* sexuality minorities, including asexual people
* people with disabilities, both visible and invisible
* neurodivergent people
* people with chronic illnesses or diseases
* religious and ethnic minorities
* age minorities (under ~21, over ~50)
* people experiencing poverty
* homeless and home/food insecure people
* caregivers of children or other dependents
* people who have experienced trauma and its aftermath (PTSD, anxiety, etc)
* people living with or recovering from substance abuse
