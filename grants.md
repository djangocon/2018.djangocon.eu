## Opportunity Grants

DjangoCon Europe 2018 will offer grants to attendees and speakers, so that those who might otherwise not be able to
attend won't hesitate to participate.  Some expenses for the conference attendance (which can include travel, hotel,
registration and etc.) will be covered for opportunity grant recipients.

We actively encourage people to apply for an opportunity grant. While we wish we could give grants to everyone who
applies, we do not have the funds to do that. Our goal is to get the most people to DjangoCon by optimizing the funds we
have.

By "optimizing" we mean several things:

* Conferences are a meeting place for developers from all around the globe. Therefore, the selection process is designed
  to benefit people that we believe make a difference, particularly speakers and tutorial presenters, as well as notable
  open source contributors.
* Additionally, the selection process attempts to promote a more diverse DjangoCon Europe. While encouraging diversity
  takes many forms, we're happy to use the opportunity grant program as a very direct method of supporting diversity
  within the Django community.
* Finally, the process tries to help people with lower incomes, be it because of their location (lower income countries)
  or their profession (such as students, or the unemployed).

And finally, our opportunity grant program encourages people who are part of an underrepresented or marginalised group
in tech. These include but are not limited to:

* women and other gender minorities of all expressions and identities; e.g. trans, agender and non-binary people
* people of color
* sexuality minorities, including asexual people
* people with disabilities, both visible and invisible
* neurodivergent people
* people with chronic illnesses or diseases
* religious and ethnic minorities
* age minorities (under ~21, over ~60)
* people experiencing poverty
* homeless and home/food insecure people
* caregivers of children or other dependents
* people who have experienced trauma and its aftermath (PTSD, anxiety, etc)
* people living with or recovering from substance abuse
