<p>After you’ve met our Platinum sponsor GoDaddy in our last blogpost, we want to take a moment to introduce you to some more of our sponsors who made a major contribution to the success of this conference. Without them, tickets to the conference would have been much more expensive and we wouldn’t be able to hold the conference to the standards you know. Most sponsors will be present at the even! Please take a minute to talk to them and thank them for supporting the conference and that it really makes a difference – to all of us.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The first company who decided to sponsor DjangoCon Europe this year was <a href="https://www.3yourmind.com/">3YOURMIND</a>, and we’re incredibly thankful for their early commitment. 3YOURMIND is a Berlin-based company. With their award-winning software, they are pushing the boundaries of industrial 3D printing. 3YOURMIND will have a booth at the conference and they’re looking forward to meet you!</p>

<p>Our second Gold sponsor is <a href="https://www.paessler.com/">Paessler AG</a>, a Nuremberg-based company developing PRTG Network Monitor, a powerful, affordable and easy-to-use solution for monitoring IT infrastructure. More than 200,000 IT administrators from 170 countries rely on – we think that is truly impressive. They use Django a lot, and with sponsoring DjangoCon, they want to get in touch with the community.</p>

<p>You probably know our third Gold sponsor already: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> is the developer of PyCharm, an powerful IDE with integrated support for Django, powered by in-depth code analysis. As a tool for professional web developers, it also supports modern JavaScript, Docker, and has comprehensive support for SQL databases. If you want to try it out – step by at the JetBrains booth at the conference!</p>

<p>Our fourth Gold sponsor, <a href="https://www.nexmo.com/">Nexmo</a>, provides tools to help you keep in touch with your customers. Their APIs for SMS, voice messages and phone verifications allow you to create innovative and delightful customer experiences.</p>

<p>Our Silver sponsor <a href="https://ambient-innovation.com/">AMBIENT INNOVATION:</a> is a web development agency focussed on user-focused software for complex business processes. They’re based in Cologne, and will be present at the conference in person as well.</p>

<p>Our Silver sponsor <a href="https://www.maykinmedia.nl/en/">Maykin Media</a> from Amsterdam is focused on the development, hosting, and support of high-quality web applications of all kinds. Thank you for supporting us!</p>

<p>We’re happy that so many sponsors from Germany support our efforts to do this conference here. The next of them is <a href="https://prounix.de/">ProUnix</a>, another Silver sponsor for DjangoCon Europe. The Bonn-based company builds comprehensive software solutions for the public sector.</p>

<p>Also, the <a href="https://www.django-verein.de/">German Django Association</a> is supporting us with a Silver sponsorship. They have hosted DjangoCon Europe 2010 in Berlin and have supported Django-related efforts in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland ever since.</p>

<p>We’re no less thankful to our bronze sponsors <a href="http://www.jambonsw.com/">Jambon Software</a>, <a href="http://www.python-academy.com/">Python Academy</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis CI</a>, <a href="https://pretix.eu/about/de/">pretix</a>, <a href="https://lincolnloop.com/">lincoln loop</a>, and <a href="https://labdigital.nl/">lab digital</a>. Divio, 89grad, and AX Semantics supported our accessibility efforts that we’ll detail in our next blogpost.</p>
