## Accomodation

As Heidelberg receives many, many tourists, and hosts its fair share of conferences and other
events, there are plenty of hotels and hostels in the city. Of course, there is also a constant
interest in those rooms. We recommend reserving a room or bed somewhere as soon as you are sure you
want to come to Heidelberg. The hotel search portal of your choice will help you in finding one.

We are currently talking to Hotels to get fixed contingents for the DjangoCon Europe participants.
We will update this page with news as soon as we know more!
