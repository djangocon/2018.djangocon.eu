## Venues

### Conference venue

The conference venue is the beautiful Heidelberg [City Hall](http://www.heidelberg-kongresshaus.de/)
(»Stadthalle Heidelberg«), a central building from 1903. Its address is Neckarstaden 24, 69117 Heidelberg.

**Due to short notice construction work, the buses are not stopping at the venue. We recommand to walk from Bismarckplatz or take the bus to
Marstallstr., which is slightly closer.**

### Sprints & workshops venue

After we've talked about software for three days, we want to dive in
and get practical on the weekend. On Saturday and Sunday we invite
you to join us for two days of Sprints and Workshops. You haven't
contributed to Open Source before? No problem! A Sprint is the single
most perfect opportunity to get started. Experienced contributors will
be present and ready to help you with any problems.

The sprints will take place at [Dezernat 16](http://www.dezernat16.de/), a former fire station. Its
address is Emil-Maier-Str. 16, 69115 Heidelberg.
We will be sprinting in the
large former vehicle hall on the ground floor as well as in the former
gym on the top floor. On first floor, you can find workshops as well as a
quiet room if you need to take a break. Food and drinks will be served
on the ground floor.

### Party location

This year marks the 10th edition of DjangoCon Europe and we believe
this calls for a birthday party! We want you to celebrate with us on
Thursday night at halle02, starting off at 20.30. There will be no dinner
available at the party, so make sure to grab something on the way.
Located on the backside of the Central Station, on the grounds of the
former goods station, halle02 has been the go-to location for parties,
concerts and other events for a decade before Heidelberg's youngest
neighborhood "Bahnstadt" has been built right next to it. Our party will
take place in their concert hall – and if we're lucky with the weather,
there will be some space outside as well.

**Adress:** Zollhofgarten 2, 69115 Heidelberg

Please look for this address on a map service of your choice and have a look at the photo story on how to reach the
party, posted in the announcements channel of our attendee Slack.
