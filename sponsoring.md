## Sponsoring

We are only able to run this conference with the support of sponsors that share our goal to create a wonderful,
diverse and insightful event. If you are interested in sponsoring DjangoCon Europe 2018, please check out our
brochure at the link below for more details.

If you have any questions or want to talk about individual sponsoring opportunities, our sponsorship team is
more than happy to answer all your emails at sponsors@djangocon.eu.

### Why sponsor?

* If you are making a product that is useful to Django developers, such as developer tools, hosting platforms or
  SaaS services, this is the **perfect marketing opportunity** for you. A booth at our conference will enable you
  to meet hundreds of potential customers of your product.

* There is no better place to **recruit Django developers**. DjangoCon Europe is the largest single gathering of
  Django developers in the world. Sponsoring DjangoCon Europe will put you directly in front of your candidate pool,
  since many attendees will be skilled developers seeking their next big step.

* If you use Django or related projects to build your software products, sponsoring DjangoCon Europe is a good way to
  **give something back** to the community and say "thanks" to its members. At the same time, sponsoring allows us to
  keep ticket prices affordable and even offer financial aid for developers from marginalized groups who could not
  join otherwise.

* DjangoCon Europe has a great track record in supporting **diversity in tech**. Last year's editions had been able to
  attract 40 % to 50 % female speakers and attendees from very different cultural and social backgrounds. We are
  committed to continue this tradition and we need strong partners to make this possible.

* Your own **employees** can profit a lot by attending DjangoCon Europe. Not only does the conference provide valuable
  education in form of talks and workshops that improve their professional and technical skills, it is also the single
  best place to start building a network within a community of potential future partners.

### Where does your money go to?

DjangoCon Europe is run entirely by volunteers, on a non-profit basis. All the support we receive will go towards
covering the costs of the event and reducing the cost for our attendees. This includes:

* catering and refreshments
* venue hire
* technical services
* financial assistance for travel and accommodation for speakers and attendees on lower budgets
* video recording for talks
* live speech-to-text transcription of all talks
* conference merchandise and the conference program booklet
* free child care for our attendees
* basic running expenses

Anything left over after the conference will be donated to the Django Software Foundation or used for future non-profit open source events.
