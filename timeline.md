## Rough Timeline

We are trying very hard to make this conference enjoyable to you even before it
has started. One of the things we hope will be helpful is this timeline. Please
understand that this is a **rough** timeline â€“ as we cannot see into the
future, some things might move around, but we will communicate every noticable
change in a blog post!
