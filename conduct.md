## Code of Conduct

DjangoCon Europe aims to be a welcoming event where people meet in a friendly environment.
Accordingly, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other participants
throughout the conference.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and
volunteers at DjangoCon Europe 2018 event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.
Organizers will enforce this code before and throughout the event (including related activites such
as the social events).

### In short

* DjangoCon Europe is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
  regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
  religion.
* We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
* Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, evening
  events, and the conference hotel.
* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Don’t publish
  individual photographs of people without their consent. Remember that harassment and sexist,
  racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for DjangoCon Europe.
* Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference
  without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

### Longer version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks
or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes
can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for
DjangoCon Europe.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they
deem appropriate, including a warning to the offender or expulsion from the conference with no
refund.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues, the conference hotel, and
conference-related social events.

please contact the Conduct team immediately either in person, or by sending an email to
conduct@djangocon.eu.

The DjangoCon staff is well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed
with the situation. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security

safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
