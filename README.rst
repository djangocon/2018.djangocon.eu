DjangoCon Europe 2018 website
-----------------------------

This is the website of DjangoCon Europe 2018. It uses jekyll_, so you'll need
to install a couple of dependencies if you want to contribute texts (and see
how they look beforehand).

```
gem install jekyll bundler jekyll-feed
```

To see the DjangoCon Europe 2018 website, run::

    jekyll s

If you've added a blog post (by adding a new file in ``_posts``) that will be
released in the future, you'll need to run::

    jekyll s --future
